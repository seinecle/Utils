# Utils classes 
These are a couple of helper java classes I often use in my projects. They are written with a preference for speed of execution. Here are some that you might find most useful:  


### Clock.java
A simple way to measure the execution time of part of your code, not for benchmark but to read in your logs. Outputs to System.out

### Multiset
Convenience class replacing the Multiset by Guava (when I realized I imported Guava just for this class)

### FindAllPairs
USeful to count all co-occurrences in a set of elements. Not multithreaded but still very optimized.
